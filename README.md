# Dex BOSH Release

This is a [BOSH](http://bosh.io/) release for [Dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex).

## Disclaimer

This is NOT presently a production ready BOSH release. This is a work in progress. It is suitable for experimentation and may not become supported in the future.

## Usage

### Upload the BOSH release

To use this BOSH release, first upload it to your BOSH:

```
bosh target BOSH_HOST
git clone https://github.com/frodenas/dex-boshrelease.git
cd dex-boshrelease
bosh upload release releases/dex/dex-1.yml
```

### Create a BOSH deployment manifest

Now create a deployment file (using the files at the [examples](https://github.com/frodenas/dex-boshrelease/blob/master/manifests/) directory as a starting point).

### Deploy using the BOSH deployment manifest

Using the previous created deployment manifest, now we can deploy it:

```
bosh deployment path/to/deployment.yml
bosh -n deploy
```
